# Visualizing the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations data in the US

## Datasets used:
The first [dataset](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2021.csv) is produced by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), and it focuses on COVID-19 cases and deaths within each county/state of the US in 2021 (i.e. it records cases and deaths of COVID-19 each day by county). 

The second [dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/us_state_vaccinations.csv) is compiled by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), and it contains information on the various vaccination data of each state throughout the years. 

## What can you expect to learn from this project?

1. The trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US
2. The temporal evolution of COVID-19 vaccination counts and case fatality rates in the US
3. The geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations administered per hundred people in the US

#### Notes about the visualizations: 
1. All visualizations presented are built using data from Jan. 12nd, 2021 to Dec. 30th, 2021.
2. Case Fatality Rate for COVID-19 is calculated as the number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.
