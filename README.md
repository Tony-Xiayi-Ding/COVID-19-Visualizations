# Visualizing the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations data in the US

## Datasets used:
The first dataset is produced by the New York Times, and it focuses on COVID-19 cases and deaths within each county/state of the US in 2021 (i.e. it records cases and deaths of COVID-19 each day by county). The second dataset is compiled by Our World in Data, and it contains information on the various vaccination data of each state throughout the years. 

## What can you expect to learn from this project?

1. The trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US
2. The temporal evolution of COVID-19 vaccination counts and case fatality rates in the US
3. The geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations administered per hundred people in the US

#### Notes: 
1. All visualizations presented below are built on data from Jan. 12nd, 2021 to Dec. 30th, 2021.
2. Case Fatality Rate for COVID-19 is calculated as the number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.
